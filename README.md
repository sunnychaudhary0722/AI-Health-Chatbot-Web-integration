# AI Health Chatbot Web integration
AI Health Chatbot 🌐💡

📌 Overview

AI Health Chatbot is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Random Forest Classifier to analyze symptoms, ask follow-up questions, and provide disease predictions along with precautions and health advice.

This project demonstrates how AI can assist in preliminary healthcare guidance (not a replacement for doctors).
